My First API Project: Dog API
This repository contains my first API project, where I utilized the Dog API to fetch random images of dogs. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook file named api.ipynb.

About the Dog API
The Dog API provides access to a large database of dog images, allowing developers to retrieve random dog images, images of specific breeds, and more.

You can find more information about the Dog API on their official website.
